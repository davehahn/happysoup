    <textOnly>Hello,

This is a courtesy message to follow up with any details about your new boat purchase in which you would like to share.

We at Legend hope you&#39;ve been enjoying your time on the water so far!  We want to make sure that you are completely, 100% satisfied with your new boat and that you will enjoy it for years to come. To ensure that everything is exactly the way you want it, we would like to invite you to have a Multi-Point Courtesy Inspection with your first scheduled 20 hour service.

The inspection is a simple overview of the vessel to ensure things are all in good working order. At the time of booking your 20 hour service, please just notify if you would also like us to preform the inspection at no addition cost to you.


It is found that all too often, boat owners are willing to live with a slight inconvenience on their boat, when really it just requires the simplest tweak on our end.  When you come in, please tell us everything! Any concerns you may have, anything that you are unsure of, anything that you require further training with, Anything!  In return, we will look over your boat package and ensure that everything is where it should be and working correctly.

Your lifelong boating happiness is paramount to us and like any vehicle, regular boat inspections and maintenance help keep you on the water and out of the Shop!

I look forward to our many future service endeavours together and am happy to welcome you into the Legend Family.  If you have any questions or comments please contact the Customer Care Department in Barrie.
