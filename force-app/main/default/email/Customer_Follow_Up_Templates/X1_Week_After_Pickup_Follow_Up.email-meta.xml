    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

It has been one week since you picked up your new boat and we hope you&#39;ve gotten a chance to experience the thrills of being on the water in a Legend Boat!

Please let us know how you are enjoying yourself so far, we love your feedback.  We would appreciate hearing about your first experience on the water and also if you have any comments or suggestions.

To be sure you are maintaining the quality of your boat, we suggest the following Service Schedule:

Fuel Treatment with each Fill Up
Check the Pressure Regularly
Grease the Trailer Wheel Bearings
Mercury Service After your First 20 Running Hours
Impeller/Water Pump Service Every 100 Hours or 3 Years
Winterization - Be Sure to Book Annually Every Fall

Again, thank you so much for becoming a member of our Legend Family and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours in Boating,
