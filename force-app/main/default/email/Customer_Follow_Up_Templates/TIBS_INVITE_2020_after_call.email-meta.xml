    <subject>Legend Boats - Invitation to Toronto International Boat Show</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

Summer is over… Start your summer fun in January with us at the Toronto International Boat Show!

Thank you for spending time with me on the phone discussing our line of boats.

I just wanted to extend to you an invitation to come and see us at the Toronto International Boat Show, January 2020.

If you&#39;re thinking about creating memories and having a blast on the water with family and friends next summer, you don’t want to miss us at the boat show!

Legend Boats has an Award Winning Booth that is different every year and we want you to come and see what we&#39;ve cooked up this time. We will have almost every one of our boats &amp; Pontoons on display, plus lots of great extras for you to check out. We are sure to turn heads with our unveiling of the “Q” Series pontoon, new deck boat and our revamped Splash Series.

I just wanted to extend an invitation to come see us at the Toronto International Boat Show.  I have two complimentary tickets for you, all I ask is that we set a date and time for you to pick them up at the show.

The show starts Friday, January 17th - Sunday, January 26th at the Enercare Centre. Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll be happy to arrange an appointment. Simply email, text, or call and we can set something up; I will then be able to assist you from the moment you arrive.

With Guaranteed pickup by spring, the most standard features paired with boat show savings there truly is no better time to buy!

From all of us here at Legend Boats, Happy New Year to you and your family. We hope to get you on the water sooner than later.

Looking forward to seeing you there!



Yours in boating,
