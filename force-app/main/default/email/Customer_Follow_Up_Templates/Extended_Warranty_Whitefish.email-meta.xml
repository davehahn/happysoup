    <textOnly>Hi there {!Account.FirstName},

I hope you and your family had a great  summer on your new boat! Hopefully you haven&#39;t had reason to bring your motor in to be serviced because I noticed that you didn&#39;t take the Extended Warranty on your Mercury motor when you took ownership of your boat.

The investment in Extended Warranty is often less than the cost of the first major repair that would be covered under warranty. For a short window of time I can still qualify you for the original Extended Warranty rates as discussed.

I would like to give you another opportunity to protect your new Mercury engine and consider the Extended Warranty again.

Thank you again for being a valued member of the Legend Family, please feel free to call me if you have any questions and, of course, if you would like to take advantage of this offer!

Yours in Boating,
