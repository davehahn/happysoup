    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

Tomorrow&#39;s the big day! We can&#39;t wait to finally welcome you into the Legend Family.

We have some detailed instructions for you to make the pick up and orientation process as simple as possible.  When you arrive tomorrow at your scheduled pick up time:

Enter in the main gates and go to the left to park in front of the Showroom.
When you enter the main doors, go to the right and approach the Service desk.
Tell them your name and that you are there to pick up your new Legend boat package.  We will take it from there!

Again a big congratulations on joining the Legend Family and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

See you tomorrow!

Sincerely,
