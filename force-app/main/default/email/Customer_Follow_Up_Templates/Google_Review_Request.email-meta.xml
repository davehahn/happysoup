    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},


I hope youâ€™ve been enjoying your time on the water.  Please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know if I can do anything else to help make this the best summer yet!  Also, if you could send me a picture of yourself enjoying your time on the water, I&#39;d love to add it to our &quot;Wall of Fame!&quot;



The other reason I&#39;m writing is to ask you a small favour. Would you be able take a few minutes and post a review on the Legend Boats Google + page?  It could make a significant difference to someone looking into buying a new boat if they see why you enjoyed your experience with Legend Boats!


Just click here to post some specifics about your experience



If you are not sure what to write, you could answer these questions:


1. Why did you buy from Legend Boats vs. other dealers?

2. Why did you buy a Legend vs. other manufactures?

3. What surprised you about your experience?

4. Why do you love boating?


Thank you so much for your time to write this review! Let me know if I can do anything else to be of service.


Yours in Boating,



Lisa Turcott
