    <subject>Legend Boats - Toronto International Boat Show</subject>
    <textOnly>Happy New Year!

I just wanted to extend to you an invitation to come see us at the Toronto International Boat Show 2020!


Legend Boats has an Award Winning Booth that is different every year and we want you to come see what we&#39;ve cooked up this time. We will have nearly every one of our boats on display, plus lots of great extras for you to check out.


2020 brings a whole new year!  We are very excited with the launch of our new D21and D23 Vibe full windshield deck boats and the amazing all new Q Series Pontoon boats.  We are re-introducing our Enjoy Pontoons with new colors creating a fresh new look.


The boat show arrives Friday Jan. 17th - Sunday Jan. 26th at the Enercare Centre in Toronto Exhibition grounds.


Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll be happy to arrange an appointment where we can go through the models from top to bottom! Simply email, text, or call and we will set something up.


With fantastic savings on previous model years, paired with Boat Show savings there truly is no better time to buy!


From all of us here at Legend Boats we thank you for your continued interest!

Yours in Boating,
