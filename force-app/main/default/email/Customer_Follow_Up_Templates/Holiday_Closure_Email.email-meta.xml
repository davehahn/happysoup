    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

We just wanted to let you know that we would be closed this Saturday through to Monday for the holiday.  We hope that you get a chance to get out and enjoy the water this weekend.

As always, if you have any questions, concerns or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Have a great holiday!
