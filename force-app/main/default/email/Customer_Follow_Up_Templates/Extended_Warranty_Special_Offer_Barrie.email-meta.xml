    <textOnly>Hi there {!Account.FirstName},

I hope that you have been well since we last spoke and that you&#39;re anticipating the warm weather as much as we are!

I know we&#39;ve already discussed the Extended Warranty when you purchased your boat, but I just wanted to reiterate that the investment in Extended Warranty is often less than the cost of the first major repair that would be covered under warranty.

I hope I can entice you to protect your investment with a special offer of 5% off the cost of the extended warranty on you motor!

Thank you again for being a valued member of the Legend Family, please feel free to call me if you have any questions and, of course, if you would like to take advantage of this offer!

Yours in Boating,

Jeana Davis
