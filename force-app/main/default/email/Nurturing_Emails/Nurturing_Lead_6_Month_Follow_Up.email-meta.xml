    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I thought I would touch base with you again and see how you&#39;re doing.  If you want to continue our discussion from before, please feel free to drop me a line. I&#39;m always happy to chat with you and answer any questions you may have.  Even if you have a quirky fishing or boating story that you want to share, I would love to hear it!

As before, if you are no longer considering a long, happy life with Legend Boats, please let me know.

Thanks again

Yours in Boating,
