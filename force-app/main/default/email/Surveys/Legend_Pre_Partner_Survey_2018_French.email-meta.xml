    <subject>Bonjour Ã©quipe {!Account.Name}!</subject>
    <textOnly>Who wants a $10/hr warranty labour rate increase? Everyone I hope!

All I need you to do to get this increase, that will remain in effect on a continuing basis is to help make us better! Sounds like a win/win right?

In order for your partner meeting day to be as effective as possible and to maximize our breakout sessions with each department, I am counting on your feedback! Now is the time! With your ability to sit with each department, Marketing, Parts, Production, Warranty, and Dealer Care, on top of our group discussions we want to ensure we get as much info out ahead of time so we are prepared for your arrival!

This survey will only take about 10-15 minutes to complete, but that seems pretty worth it for the amount of money you&#39;ll be receiving from your increase!

Please share these survey questions with your teams, take some time and please let us know how we can become a better partner for you moving forward. Again, all you have to do is complete this survey and you will automatically earn a 10/hr increase in your labour rate effective Sept 30, 2018

Please ask all of your team members to get involved and help with this survey.</textOnly>
