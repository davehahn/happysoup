    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Account},

I&#39;m glad you made it to the Toronto Sportsman Show. I wanted to take this time to thank you again for becoming part of our Legend Family! I also wanted to let you know that if your Memory Maker is unavailable for any reason whatsoever, you can contact me for anything you need.

At Legend, we are always striving to create the ultimate customer experience, from buying to boating. I have attached a link to a quick feedback form with 7 short questions and I would really appreciate if you took a few minutes to share your feelings about your Legend experience here at the show.
