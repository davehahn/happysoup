    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

My name is Mardy St. Jacques.  I&#39;ve been a Memory Maker at Legend Boats for nearly 20 years and it is with an incredibly heavy heart that I must inform you of the passing of the gentleman who was helping you with your boating experience, David Gariup.

Dave was a great sales rep and wanted nothing more than to ensure his customers were getting the right boat for their needs and that they were having as much fun as possible during the process and forever after.

Due to these unforeseen circumstances, your Account has been passed to me so that I can ensure you&#39;re taken care of and that all of your questions are answered.

If you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to let me know.  My goal is to carry on Dave&#39;s legacy and make sure that above all, you&#39;re enjoying boating in every facet.

Thank you for your time.

Yours in Boating,

Mardy St. Jacques
