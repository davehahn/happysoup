    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

It has been a few days since we spoke on the phone.  I would like to arrange for you to visit the dealership as it is impossible to appreciate all the features our boats offer over the phone.

At Legend, we have a great selection of new and previously owned boats.  There will be absolutely no pressure if you, for any reason, should choose to shop other dealerships.

Taking ownership of a boat should be a pleasant experience.  You can be assured you will be very pleased with Legend&#39;s service before, during and after you take ownership of your new boat.

When do you think you could make it in for a visit?


Best Regards,
