Owning a boat is amazing! The freedom, the bonding, the peace and quiet, whatever floats your boat, really!  I hope that you&#39;ve spent the last year dreaming about boating.  I wanted to reach out to see if I can make your dreams a reality!

We have some great news for you! We now have access to some new lenders for financing options.

If you would like to revisit the boat package and relook into getting pre-approved let me know.  I&#39;ll put you in touch with our Business Office Manager, John Winter to further look into getting you on the water this year.

Since we first met, Legend Boats has gotten bigger and better! We always do, and there&#39;s no better time than now to jump on board with us. Please give me a call or send me an email or a text to go over what Legend Boats can do for you!

I look forward to hearing from you and helping you finally get out on the water in a new Legend!


As always, Yours in Boating,
