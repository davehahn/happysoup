    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I just wanted to check in and see how you were doing.  It&#39;s been a while since we first met and I showed you through our line-up of Legend Boats, so if you need a refresher or a new Quote, I&#39;ll be sure to send one your way. Also, if, for whatever reason, you are no longer in the market for buying a boat, please let me know.

My goal in emailing you is to ensure that you&#39;re not missing out on owning a great Canadian product and that you get to take advantage of all of the special attributes that go along with it.

Once again, it is a pleasure to work through this process with you.  I hope this finds you well and that we get a chance to chat soon.

Yours in Boating,
