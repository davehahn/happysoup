    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I hope all has been well.  I wanted you to know I like to make every effort to provide my customers with the best possible service when they are considering ownership of a new boat.  While I certainly don&#39;t wish to appear &quot;pushy&quot; in my attempt to provide the best experience, I do take great pride in my work.

Because of this, I am always trying to learn more about myself and how I can improve what I do.  Would you help me with this by considering the following questions?  Your comments are very important to me.

1. What did you like the most about Legend Boats and the
boat we looked at?

2. What did you like the least?

3. Did you feel I took your needs and special circumstances into consideration?

4. What can I do to better serve you?

5. Have you purchased another make or model?

Thank you very much for your time and comments.


At your service,
