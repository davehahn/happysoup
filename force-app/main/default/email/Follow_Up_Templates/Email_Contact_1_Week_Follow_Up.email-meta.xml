    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I hope my last e-mail was helpful.  I am quite interested in helping you get onto the water so please don&#39;t misconstrue my persistence as being pushy.

I would like to extend an invitation to you to come check out what we have to offer in person.   What would be a good time for you to come visit us?

At Legend Boats, we pride ourselves in product knowledge.  You are about to make a very important decision and I want to make sure you are armed with all the necessary information.

Thanks again for considering Legend as you shop for a new boat.


At your service,
