    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}

NEW YEAR
NEW YOU
NEW BOAT?

I just wanted to extend to you an invitation to come see us at the Toronto International Boat Show.

Legend Boats has an Award Winning Booth that is different every year and we want you to come see what we&#39;ve cooked up this time. We will have nearly every one of our boats &amp; Pontoons on display, plus lots of great extras for you to check out. We are sure to turn heads with our all new XTE series and our new unveiling of the &quot;L&quot; series pontoon.

The show starts January 18th- January 27th at the Enercare Centre. Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll be happy to arrange an appointment. Simply email, text, or call and we can set something up.

With Guaranteed pickup by spring, the most standard features paired with boat show savings there truly is no better time to buy!

From all of us here at Legend Boats Happy New Year to you and your family. We hope to get you on the water sooner than later.

Yours in Boating,

Henry Nguyen
