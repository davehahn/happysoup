    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

Summer is finally here and we&#39;re more excited than ever to get you out on the water and enjoying the boating lifestyle! This weekend marks the third and last Legend Boats Open House of the year, and believe me, it&#39;s going to be awesome!

We&#39;ve introduced a new way for you to enjoy your boat all summer without worrying about payments! That&#39;s right! If you purchase select, in stock models, you&#39;ll have the added incentive of no payments and no interest until January 2016!! All enjoyment, no payments! Oh yeah!

The Showroom is stocked, the BBQ is ready, the boats are in the water ready for a test drive, our Pontoon Alley is set up displaying our newest, most innovative pontoon lineups and our Deal Dock is ready to show you the pontoons that are dripping in savings!

Come take advantage of our best deals yet, have a bite to eat and even enter your name for a chance to win an iPad!  This weekend is going to be amazing, but it&#39;ll be truly Legendary with you!

Please feel free to send me an email or give me a call to set up a time that you might want to come see (and, of course, play in) our boats.  I want to be sure that I can give you a full demonstration of the memories that you could be creating this summer on the water!

From all of us here at Legend Boats, we truly hope to see you there!

Yours in Boating,
