    <textOnly>Hi there,

My name is Jackie and I am the newest Memory Maker at Legend Boats in Barrie.  Matt, the gentleman that was helping you before has moved up North to be closer to his family and as such, your Account has been assigned to me.

I am still learning, but so far I am very excited to be part of the Legend Boats team!  Please feel free to reach out to me whenever you have a boating question (if I don&#39;t know the answer, I&#39;ve got an awesome boating team behind me here that can help!) or if you would like an updated quote since we just unveiled our 2017 line-up!

Also, as you might know, the Toronto International Boat Show is coming up and for several consecutive years in a row, Legend has had one of the biggest award winning booths there.  If you&#39;re interested in checking out the show, let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do about getting you in for a special preview of our 2017 line-up.

Thanks for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!

Newly Yours in Boating,

Jackie Carrigan
Memory Maker
