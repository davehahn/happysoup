    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

I hope you&#39;ve had a great Fall and that you&#39;re ready for your Holiday Season!  I just wanted to extend to you an invitation to come see us at the Toronto International Boat Show.

Legend Boats has an Award Winning Booth that is different every year and we want you to come see what we&#39;ve cooked up this time.  We will have nearly every one of our boats on display, plus lots of great extras for you to check out.

Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll see what I can do about maybe scoring you a free ticket...

From all of us here at Legend Boats, we hope you have safe and happy Holidays!

Yours in Boating,
