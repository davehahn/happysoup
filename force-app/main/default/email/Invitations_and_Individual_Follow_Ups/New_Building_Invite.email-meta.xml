    <subject>Come Visit the New Legend Headquarters!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

We&#39;ve moved! We&#39;re very excited to announce that Legend Boats is now open in it&#39;s brand new Legend Headquarters, in the same great location, just a short beautiful 20 minute drive from Sudbury!

We&#39;re so proud and we can&#39;t wait to show it off. With over 55,000 square feet of showroom, parts, service, shop, and offices all in one location to serve you best.

Our new indoor, heated showroom offers more than 40 boats on display. You can experience nearly our entirely catalogue up close and personal. Get right into the driver&#39;s seat and experience our brand new 2017 models. Feel everything but the water (until spring!).

To warm you up in this cold weather, we&#39;re bringing all of Toronto Boat Savings directly to you, and have burning hot deals on our 2017 lineup and limited 2016 inventory! Customize your boat, and Pick your Promo, whether it be accessories savings, preferred financing rates, or 8-Year Mercury Platinum Protection.

We&#39;d love for you to come visit our new home. No housewarming gift required. Call ahead today to book an appointment or just drop by for a chat.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Yours in Boating,
