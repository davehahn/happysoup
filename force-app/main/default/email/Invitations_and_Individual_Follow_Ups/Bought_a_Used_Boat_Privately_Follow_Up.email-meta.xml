    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I hope you had a great summer in your new(ish) boat!  I know you didn&#39;t end up taking ownership of a brand new boat from Legend, but I thought I would check in and make sure that you are happy with your current boat.

Did you find that there were any problems? Was it awesome?  Is there anything we can help with?  Legend Boats is always open to service any kind of boat and it would give us a chance to reconnect and get to know your specific needs for your boat.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or want to schedule an appointment to come in and see some brand new Legend models or just have your boat looked at.

Thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you!

Always Yours in Boating,
