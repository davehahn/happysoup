    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Happy New Years!

I just wanted to extend to you an invitation to come see us at the Toronto International Boat Show!

Legend Boats has an Award Winning Booth that is different every year and we want you to come see what we&#39;ve cooked up this time. We will have nearly every one of our boats on display, plus lots of great extras for you to check out.  We are all set to launch our new XTE series of fishing boats.  We have new Splash models planned and our all new L-Series of pontoons is going to blow you away!

The boat show arrives Jan 18-27 the Enercare centre ( the exhibition grounds ) Toronto

Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll be happy to arrange an appointment where we can go through the models from top to bottom! Simply email, text, or call and we can set something up.

With fantastic savings on previous model years, paired with boat show savings there truly is no better time to buy!

From all of us here at Legend Boats we thank you for your continued interest!

Yours in Boating,

Jesse Davis
Director of National Sales
