    <subject>Come on out to the Toronto International Boat Show</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to take a moment to wish you a very Happy New Year!  It has been a while since we last spoke and I wanted to touch base with you to see if you have found a boat that meets your needs.  Toronto International Boat Show is fast approaching, running from January 21st to the 29th, 2017 at the Direct Energy Centre.

If you would like to attend please give me a call at 705-662-1994 and I will be sure to have some free passes for you.  If however you are not able to make your way to Toronto, and would like to know about the amazing early buy savings, please send me an email and I would be more than happy to work with you.

Hoping to see you on the water this summer!  Wishing you and your family all the best for 2017

Yours in Boating
