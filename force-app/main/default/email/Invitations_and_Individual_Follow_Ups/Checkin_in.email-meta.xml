    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Just wanted to check in to see how your season is going so far? It&#39;s too bad the weather isn&#39;t holding up like we wanted, but at least we got a few nice weekends this summer!

Please feel free to email or call me back to let me know how your boat is doing and if you have any questions, concerns, or even stories.  You&#39;re part of the Legend Family now and we&#39;d love to hear about how you spent your boating season!

Thank you for your time

Yours in boating,
