    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I hope all has been well with you since we last spoke.  I&#39;ve talked to so many people since the Boat Show started that I&#39;m not sure if I mentioned that you can win $10,000 by buying a boat at the Toronto International Boat Show!

When you purchase a Legend Boat, your name is entered into a draw to win $10,000 to put towards the purchase of your new baby.

Just thought I would share with you since these are incredible savings!

Please let me know if you wish to take advantage of this opportunity.

Thanks and have a great day!

Yours in Boating,
