    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

I see that your boat is in for servicing.  I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I took a look at it and have determined that it really is a beautiful boat!  I&#39;ve spoken with our Sales Manager and he agrees with me.

The reason I am sending you this e-mail is to let you know that if you wish to trade in your boat for a brand new Legend, we are prepared to offer you a very reasonable trade in value.

There are several benefits to upgrading your boat package after 5 to 7 years, such as higher trade in values, taking advantage of the latest technologies Legend has to offer, higher performance and, of course, being the talk of the lake!

If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to give me a call or reply to this e-mail.

I look forward to hearing from you about this exciting opportunity!

Yours in boating,
