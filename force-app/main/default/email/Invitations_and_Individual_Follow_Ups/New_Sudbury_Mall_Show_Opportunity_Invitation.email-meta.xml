    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I hope all has been well with you since we last spoke and that you&#39;re enjoying this lovely, snowy weather!  I just wanted to extend an invitation for you to come and take another look at our boats:

Legend Boats will be set up in the New Sudbury Shopping Centre starting this Sunday January 24th till Sunday 31st.

Reasons to come to the New Sudbury Mall Show:

No interest No payments until Summer
Boat before you pay
Toronto Boat Show Pricing (Yes available in Sudbury!)
2016 New line up just released
Massive Non-current savings (While quantities last)
Pontoon, Full windshield, Side console and Utility Boats on display
Enter to win a brand new iPad!

Please feel free to send me an email or give me a call to set up a date and time that you might want to come see (and of course play) in our boats.  I want to be sure that I can give you a full demonstration of the memories that you could be creating this summer on the water!

From all of us here at Legend Boats, we truly hope to see you there!

Yours in Boating,
