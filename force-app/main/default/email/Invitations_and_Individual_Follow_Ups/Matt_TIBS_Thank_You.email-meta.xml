    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I would like to thank you for your time and for visiting the Legend Boats booth at the Toronto Boat Show.

If you have any further questions about Legend, or boating questions in general then feel free to send me an email. The only silly question is the one not asked.

Thank you again and I am excited for you to start making memories on the water!


Yours in Boating,
