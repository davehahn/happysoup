    <subject>2017 Suggested Legend Boats Parts Booking Order for {!Account.Name}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.Name},

The deadline for submitting your parts booking order is fast approaching.   We are truly excited for what 2017 has in store!

To help you take advantage of all this program has to offer, we have taken the liberty of compiling a suggested parts booking order to help you build your order.

Remember all parts booking orders receive free freight and can be financed at no cost to your dealership until next spring!  If you are not interested in the financing option, we do offer cash discounts for paying for these orders up front. There really is no downside to our program!

We have taken great care in compiling this list of parts for you.  We have taken into account what parts you ordered last year, what boats you have on order currently and of course we have included our most popular, must haves and best selling items.

Please take some time to review our suggestions and build your order today.  Your parts booking order can also provide on going savings on your future parts orders.  Your total booking order size determines what freight savings you can take advantage of in season!

On an item by item basis these charges are not significant but added up, they can amount to pure cash savings for you.  Ask your dealer rep how much money you could have saved if you had participated in this program last year. You will be surprised.

Get your orders in no later than October 31st and take advantage of us!

Thank-you for your continued partnership and remember your success, is our success.

Sincerely,

Elvis Paulino
Parts Manager
