Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As the dust settles from the Legend 2016 Dealer Event, we wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedules in joining us for what turned out to be a spectacular event!  It was a true pleasure to see you and we hope that you have learned some great tips and thoroughly enjoyed the festivities.  We hope that you are as excited about the 2016 Legend products as we are and anxious to get the season underway.

We want to make sure that we keep this momentum going and also that we have all of the input we can possibly get, going into 2016.  If you would be so kind as to take a few moments to go over our 2016 Legend Dealer Event Survey, we would very much appreciate it!  Your input is extremely valuable as you are the ones who will be embracing all of our new products, the new branding and of course being the Legend Ambassadors that you always are.

Note that this survey is completely anonymous. Feel free to include your name if you wish.



Also, for quick reference, here is a link to our new Partner Event Program and a link to our Parts Booking Order Program

Again, thank you so much from every one on the Legend Team, we&#39;re truly grateful to have you as part of our Legend Family!

All the best in the new season

Yours in Boating,
Chelsi Lauriault
