    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Once again, Legend Boats is excited to be able to offer our dealer network a parts booking program for the 2018 season.  As you are all very much aware, the marine parts industry is a volatile one and maximizing availability and pricing is key to a successful parts selling season.  Placing a parts booking order not only helps us and our suppliers produce and ship your required parts early in the season, it allows your dealership to maximize savings and, most importantly, have parts on hand, in time for the busy spring season.



In a world where price protection is virtually non existent, your Legend parts booking order guarantees your price at the time of booking!  Guaranteed inventory, immediate availability to your clients, large selection, cost effectiveness, price protection and free shipping.  Now that is peace of mind!


Please find attached our analysis of all parts ordered by your dealership last season.  We have also included a “Suggested Order” based on last year’s purchases.



If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Legend Boats Parts Department at your earliest convenience.  Over the next couple of days, a Legend Parts Representative will contact you to answer any questions you may have and to help you get your parts booking order placed online.



Please remember that all parts booking orders are due no later than September 30th  2017.


From all of us here at Legend Boats, we wish you a very successful 2018 season!
