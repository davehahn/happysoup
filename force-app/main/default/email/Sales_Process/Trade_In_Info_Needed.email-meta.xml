    <textOnly>Hello,

This is to notify you that the deal for {!Opportunity.Name} is trying to move forward without the necessary trade in information required.  In order to build this boat.

We require:

- the signed ownerships from the customer AND
- a full appraisal on the physical boat.

Please ensure that these are both complete and checked off in the Opportunity before this customer&#39;s new boat package is built.

Thank you!</textOnly>
