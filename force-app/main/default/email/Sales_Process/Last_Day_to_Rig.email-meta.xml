    <textOnly>Hey Quentin,

Just letting you know that the {!Opportunity.BoatId__c} for {!Account.Name} is scheduled to be picked up in Barrie on {!Opportunity.Delivery_Date__c}.

If this is already Rigged, please notify Lisa, if not, you may want to bump this up the schedule as it still has to have time to get to Barrie.

Any questions, please let me know.

Thanks!</textOnly>
