    <textOnly>Hey there {!Account.FirstName},

It&#39;s been a great year so far!  I hope all has been well with you too.  I know it has been a long time since we first met and I fully understand taking all the time you need to analyze your decision.  I just wanted to offer my help in any way, shape, or form to make the boat ownership process easier on you.

Please feel free to give me a call, send me an email or a text and ask anything you&#39;d like.  I am your boating expert and I aim to make sure your mind is at ease going into a new relationship with Legend Boats.

Thank you again for your time and I hope to talk to you soon.

Yours in Boating,
