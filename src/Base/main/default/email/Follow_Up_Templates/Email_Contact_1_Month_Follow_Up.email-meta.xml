    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I am hopeful you are still considering becoming the proud owner of a new Legend Boat, however, if your time frame has changed or you are no longer considering ownership of a boat, please give me a call.

I appreciate the opportunity to be of service in your boating needs. If I can help in any way whatsoever, please do not hesitate to let me know.

The market is constantly changing and if you&#39;d like, I will gladly keep you informed as new incentives or financing plans become available.


Thanks again for your interest in Legend.

Best Regards,
