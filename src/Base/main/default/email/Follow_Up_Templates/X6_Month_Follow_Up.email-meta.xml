    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I&#39;ve known you for the better part of a year now and I hope I&#39;m not over-stepping my bounds when I say that I want you as part of the Legend Family!

Being a member is great, you have access to experienced Service Personnel, on-hand Mercury Technicians, answers to any question you could ever have throughout the life of your boat, and also...your new boat itself!

Please help me help you into a new Legend Boat this year.  A quality, Canadian boat is always in style!

Always Yours in Boating,
