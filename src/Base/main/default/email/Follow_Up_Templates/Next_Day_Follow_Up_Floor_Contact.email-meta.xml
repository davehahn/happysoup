    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

It was great meeting you!  I appreciate you taking the time to stop in.  I hope that I was able to answer all of your questions.  If there is something I missed or some additional information you require, please give me a call. My goal is to help as many people onto the water as possible so they can enjoy the boating lifestyle.

Once again, thank you for visiting Legend Boats.  I hope to see you again very soon.

Best Regards,
