    <subject>Legend Boats - Get on the Water</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

A month has passed since I had the opportunity to present you our line of products.  I hope you can appreciate my persistence in trying to help you find the right boat.

As a Memory Maker, one of the things I love is the opportunity to show our product line to clients.  I appreciate you considering Legend to help you get on the water.

If you are still interested in owning a boat, I am here to help.  If you are no longer in the market or the time frame for boat ownership has changed, please let me know.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.


Regards,
