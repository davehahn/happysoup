    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

It&#39;s been a little while since we had the opportunity to discuss getting you on the water.  Buying a boat is a major purchase and I can certainly appreciate the necessity of taking the time to think it over.

You may be interested in the many financing opportunities available for your consideration.  I&#39;d be happy to discuss all the options available to you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call.  As I said before, I want to help you in any way I can.


Best Regards,
