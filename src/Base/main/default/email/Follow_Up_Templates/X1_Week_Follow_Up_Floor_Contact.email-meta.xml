    <subject>Legend Boats - The Memories are Waiting</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

It has been a little over a week since you visited me.  My interest in getting you on the water hasn&#39;t diminished one bit.  You will find I&#39;m just as persistent in providing service after you take ownership and ensuring your complete satisfaction, as I am working with you on selecting the right boat to create your memories.

I would like to ask a favour.  Present me with a challenge that I would need to overcome to get you on the water.  It can be anything:  trade-in value, price, terms, or perhaps a different boat than you were first considering.

Give me the chance, and I&#39;ll ensure you are happy with your decision.


Best Regards,
