    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},



It has been a couple of days since you visited us at the Toronto International Boat Show and spoke to {!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName}.  Our interest in getting you on the water hasn&#39;t diminished one bit.  You will find we are just as persistent in providing service after you take ownership and ensuring your complete satisfaction, as your memory maker is working with you on selecting the right boat to create your memories.



I would like to ask a favour.  Present me with a challenge that I would need to overcome to get you on the water.  It can be anything:  trade-in value, price, terms, or perhaps a different boat than you were first considering.



Give me the chance, and I&#39;ll ensure you are happy with your decision.



Best Regards,





Brad MacArthur

Sales and Operations Manager
