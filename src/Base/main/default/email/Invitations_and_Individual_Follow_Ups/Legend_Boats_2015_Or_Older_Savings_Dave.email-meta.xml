    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I wanted to keep you informed of Legend Boats&#39; offers and changes in the market that will directly effect you in terms of savings and new pricing.

We have had meetings regarding the changes firmed in the 2016 Line up. We are excited to go into the 2016 model season with some of Canada&#39;s best in class value boats from utilities all the way up to side consoles, full windshields and pontoons.  However Legend and our industry are also dealing with the US, Canadian exchange and the 2016 models will be at least 10% and in some models 15% more dollars over our 2015 line up.

This means you can save considerably by making an investment now.  Being late in July we also have offered on most models a NO INTEREST NO PAYMENTS till January 2016.  So you can buy now, enjoy the summer and fall of boating and not pay till next year.  For those of you expecting to purchase in 2016, this is a great opportunity to avoid the price increase, and get a free summer of boating by investing now.  We have some limited 2014, 2013 product but we have a good selection of 2015 which will provide in many cases thousands of dollars of savings.

If you would like to discuss the details please do not hesitate to call my cellular at 705-662-1737.  Remember we have 2015 Pricing, 2015 Savings and most models have no interest no payments till January 2016.

I wanted you, {!Account.FirstName}, to be aware of the changes in the market and make the best informed decision you can for your family boating needs.

Yours in Boating,
