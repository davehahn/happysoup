    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.FirstName}

I want to wish you and your family a very happy holiday season!

Winter is upon us, but we are still full speed ahead in boat show planning and making sure our 2017 line-up is second to none!.

Legend Boats is sure to turn some heads for the 2017 model year, starting this January 20-29th at the Toronto International Boat Show.
I know the boat show is an annual tradition for many boaters, so if are planning on coming to the show, please stop by and say hi!  Hit me up for a water or coffee in our Legend lounge, I&#39;d love to get to know you better! If you have any questions regarding your Legend Boat, please don&#39;t hesitate to call or email at anytime.

Our all new XTR series, additions to the Fseries, and our fantastic pontoon line-up will be out in full force for you to view.

If you know of any friends or family in the market for a new boat, I would love the opportunity to welcome them to the Legend family!
