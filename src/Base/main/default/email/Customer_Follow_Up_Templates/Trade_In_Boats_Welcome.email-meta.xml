    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.FirstName},

I sincerely hope that you&#39;ve been enjoying your time with your Legend Boat so far.  I know you&#39;ve had more than a few summers together and from what I&#39;ve seen, it sure looks like you and your boat have been through some awesome adventures together!

Actually, I was curious as to how much your boat would be worth, so, I hope you don&#39;t mind, but we did a quick inspection and it turns out it&#39;s worth a little more than I thought!

I just wanted to reach out and see how you might feel about trading in your boat for a brand new Legend?  Your current boat would act as a pretty decent deposit for it! We know it can be sad to say good-bye to an old friend, but we also know how much fun it can be to welcome a new friend into your life.

If you&#39;d like to know how much your boat is worth, please feel free to call or email me back.  If not, I totally understand that you&#39;re not done enjoying your boat yet and I hope that you two enjoy another season together!

Yours in Boating,
