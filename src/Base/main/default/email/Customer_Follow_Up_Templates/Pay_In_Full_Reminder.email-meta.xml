    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I hope all has been well since we last spoke and that you&#39;re already having good dreams about picking up your new boat in the Spring!

I just wanted to send a quick reminder that in order to secure all of the Savings and Promotions discussed at the Boat Show, we&#39;ll require payment of your boat package in full by January 31st, 2016.  If you have any questions regarding this, you can certainly call me at any time.

Again, thank you so much for becoming part of the Legend Family and I look forward to seeing you again in the Spring!

Yours in Boating,
