Hello {!relatedTo.Account.FirstName},
<br></br>
<br></br>
I'm glad you made it to the New Sudbury Mall Show.  I wanted to take this time to thank you again for becoming part of our Legend Family! I also wanted to let you know that if your Memory Maker is unavailable for any reason whatsoever, you can contact me for anything you need.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
At Legend, we are always striving to create the ultimate customer experience, from buying to boating.  I have attached a link to a quick feedback form with 7 short questions and I would really appreciate if you took a few minutes to share your feelings about your Legend experience here at the show.
<br></br>
