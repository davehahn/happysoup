    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

On behalf of everyone at Legend Boats, I&#39;d like to welcome you to the Legend Family! I hope you&#39;ve been dreaming fondly about the day that you get to pick up your new boat!  I&#39;m here to make sure that process goes smoothly and that your boat has proper care for its entire life.

I&#39;m Dave and I will be your Boat Specialist.

My Role as your Boat Specialist is to make sure that you are comfortable leading up to your Orientation, that all of your questions and concerns are answered and most importantly that you and your boat are well cared for throughout your life with Legend Boats.

Please expect a phone call from me shortly so that I can introduce myself, confirm your pickup date and to discuss any additional parts you want to add to your boat package before it&#39;s brought into the shop!

Again, thank you for joining our family and I can&#39;t wait to get you out on the water and making memories in your new Legend Boat!

P.S. My contact info is below, feel free to print this out, keep it on your fridge, in your car and in your boat.  I&#39;m here to help!

Yours in Boating,

Dave Alexander
Boat Specialist
