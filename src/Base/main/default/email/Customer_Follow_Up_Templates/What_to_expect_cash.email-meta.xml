    <subject>Welcome to the Legend Family. Here&#39;s what to expect next...</subject>
    <textOnly>Our 2016 Legend Pontoon Catalogue is now available for free download!


Hi {!Account.FirstName},

We would like to take this time to thank you again for joining our Legend Family and for choosing our boats to help you and your family make memories on the water!

Below is a detailed list of what you can expect from us over the next year.


Your pick-up date is now confirmed and you should have an appointment card in your possession. Should you need to reschedule your appointment, please do so sooner than later as the pick-up schedule fills up fast!


Your Boat Specialist will be in touch just before your boat goes into the Shop to be built.  They will be able to offer some popular options for your specific boat package at this time. In preparation, feel free to go through our catalogue and see if there is anything that appeals to you.


We will be sending you an email before your pickup date with instructions on what to bring to your Orientation and where to go once you get here.


After you’ve driven away with your new Legend Boat package, you will receive a survey from us. The survey will ask how communication was between you and us between now and your pickup date, as well as how we did during the Orientation. Hopefully we get a perfect 10!  If at any point during the life of your boat, there is a reason we wouldn’t get a perfect 10 on anything, let us know immediately and we will do our best to remedy the situation!


About 2 months after you’ve picked up your boat, you will receive a phone call from your Boat Specialist to schedule your free Multi-Point Courtesy Inspection, in which you will bring your boat back to us and we’ll check over all of the components to make sure everything is in ship shape


We will be giving you a call near the fall to discuss the winterization and storage of your new boat package.

In the meantime, please feel free to call your Salesperson or Business Manager with any questions you may have leading up to the day that you’ll bring home your new boat!

From all of us here at Legend Boats, thank you again and we look forward to years of creating memories together!
