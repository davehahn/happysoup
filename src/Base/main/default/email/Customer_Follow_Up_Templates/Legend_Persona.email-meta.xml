    <textOnly>Hey {!Account.FirstName},

I&#39;ve got an interesting opportunity for you.  We&#39;re looking for people just like you to take part in our Legend Boats Persona Survey.  I say people like you because we want to know what makes anyone who has shown an interest in Legend Boats tick. And that&#39;s you!

If you would be so kind as to fill out the Legend Boats Persona Survey survey, it should only take about 5 minutes of your time.  By doing so, you&#39;ll be helping Legend Boats improve upon the sphere of people we influence, but you&#39;ll also be helping yourself by being entered into a draw to win a FREE Humminbird Helix 5 Fishfinder!

Just click here to fill out the survey and hopefully get yourself a brand new fishfinder!

Thank you so much for your time to fill out this survey! Let me know if I can do anything else to be of service.


Yours in Boating,

Lisa Turcott
