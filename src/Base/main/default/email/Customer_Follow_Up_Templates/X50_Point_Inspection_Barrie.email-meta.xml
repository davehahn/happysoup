    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

We hope you&#39;ve been enjoying your time on the water so far!  We want to make sure that you are completely, 100% satisfied with your new boat and that you will enjoy it for years to come.  To ensure that everything is exactly the way you want it, I would like to invite you to come back in for a Multi-Point Courtesy Inspection!

We find that all too often, boat owners are willing to live with a slight inconvenience on their boat, when really it just requires the simplest tweak on our end.  When you come in, please tell us everything! Any concerns you may have, anything that you are unsure of, anything that you require further training with, Anything!  In return, we will look over your boat package and ensure that everything is where it should be and working correctly.

Your lifelong boating happiness is paramount to us and like any vehicle, regular boat inspections and maintenance help keep you on the water and out of the Shop!

To schedule your Multi Point Courtesy Inspection:
Please call us at the Service Desk at 1 (800) 459-8448 or
Email Legend Customer Care at barrieservice@legendboats.com.

Please be sure to let us know of any additional Services you would like completed while your boat is left with us.

We look forward to hearing from you.  Have a Legendary day!
