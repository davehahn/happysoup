    <textOnly>Here&#39;s what to expect next from Legend Boats

Congratulations on joining the Legend Family! Here&#39;s what to expect next...


Hi {!Account.FirstName},

We would like to take this time to thank you again for joining our Legend Family and for choosing our boats to help you and your family make memories on the water!

Below is a detailed list of what you can expect from us over the next year.


Your financing details and pick-up date are now confirmed and you should have an appointment card in your possession. Should you need to reschedule your appointment, please do so sooner than later as the pick-up schedule fills up fast!


Your Business Office Manager will send your boat through to the next stage and assign serial numbers for all of the key components of your package so that it can be built to your specifications.


Once serial numbers are allocated to your boat package, your Business Office Manager will schedule a time to sign your finance paperwork.


Your Boat Specialist will be in touch just before your boat goes into the Shop to be built.  They will be able to suggest a few popular options to optimize your boating experience. In preparation, feel free to go through our catalogue and see if there is anything that you may be interested in.


We will be sending you an email just before your pickup date with instructions on what to bring to your orientation and where to go once you arrive.


After you’ve driven away with your new Legend Boat package, you&#39;ll receive a survey from us.  The survey will ask about the level of communication you received leading up to your pickup date, as well as how we did during the orientation.  Hopefully we get a perfect 10!  If at any point during the ownership process you feel we haven&#39;t earned a perfect score, please let us know immediately and we will do our best to remedy the situation!


About 2 months after you’ve picked up your boat, you&#39;ll receive a phone call from your Boat Specialist to schedule your Multi-Point Courtesy Inspection. This is an opportunity for you to bring your boat back in for us to check over your boat, answer any questions, and make sure everything is awesome!


If you have any questions at all throughout the boat ownership process, please feel free to contact your Memory Maker or Business Office Manager with any questions you may have before bringing your boat home!

From all of us here at Legend Boats, thank you again and we look forward to years of creating memories together!
