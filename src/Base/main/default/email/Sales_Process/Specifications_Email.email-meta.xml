    <textOnly>Hi again {!Account.FirstName},

I hope all has been well since we spoke last and that you are anticipating the pick up of your new boat!  I am writing you on behalf of the Memory Building Supervisor here at Legend Boats. Their job is to ensure that your boat package is absolutely perfect when you pick it up on {!Opportunity.Delivery_Date__c}.

The team of Memory Builders here is excited to bring your boat into our Shop to get it ready for you to start creating your memories on the water!

If you have any special requests or have specific requirements for equipment placement, please call me as soon as possible to let me know, otherwise your boat will be built to the most popular specifications.

Thank you again for your time.

Yours in boating,
