    <textOnly>Hi there,

The Finance customer, {!Account.Name} is currently Approved but Unfunded and the boat has been tagged and is currently Pending Rigging.  Should the Shop staff go ahead building this unit?

Please send the Shop Foreman a Chatter on this customer&#39;s Opportunity ASAP letting them know whether to go ahead or not.

Thank you!</textOnly>
