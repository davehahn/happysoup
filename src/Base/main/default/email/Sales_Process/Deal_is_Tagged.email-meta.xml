    <textOnly>Hey there awesome Business Manager,

Please be advised that {!AcctSeed__Project__c.Name} is now tagged.  This is a {!AcctSeed__Project__c.Payment_Method__c} deal. If it&#39;s finance, go do your Business Manager thing, if it&#39;s cash go get the License Plate and Boat Numbers.  Also, just continue being amazing, you&#39;re really good at that :)

Thanks!</textOnly>
